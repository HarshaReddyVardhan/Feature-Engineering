For running the codes all the .M files are necessary.
We are using functions from other files which are created by us.

The code may produce errors if the images generated are of not same size.
If the size of the image may be different and SSIM accuracy may not work.
After Generating the ground Truth, the images had different sizes and channels we have changed  them according to our requirement.
